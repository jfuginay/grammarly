# Engie Bot Word-by-Word Animation Feature

## Overview

This feature enhances the user experience by adding an animated Engie Bot that visually moves through text changes when applying suggestions in the analysis view. The bot goes word by word through the changes, highlighting each word being modified, and expressing different emotions based on the type of change.

## Key Components

1. **Word-by-Word Animation**:
   - Engie Bot moves through each word in the text change
   - Words being changed are highlighted with a pulsing animation
   - Smooth transitions between words create a natural animation effect

2. **Emotional Feedback**:
   - Engie Bot shows "excited" emotion when adding text
   - Displays "thoughtful" emotion when removing text
   - Shows "happy" when adding new words
   - Shows "concerned" when removing words

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Precise text position calculation using DOM manipulation
   - State management for animation control
   - Custom CSS animations for smooth transitions
   - Integration with existing suggestion application flow

## How to Test

1. Enter text in the left editor
2. Wait for analysis to complete
3. Click on a suggestion in the right (analysis) editor
4. Watch as Engie Bot animates through the words being changed

## Implementation Notes

- The animation only appears in the read-only analysis view (right side)
- Position calculation accounts for different word lengths and line breaks
- Animation timing is optimized for readability (800ms per word)
- Engie Bot scale is adjusted to fit nicely within the editor

## Future Enhancements

- Add sound effects for different types of changes
- Implement more varied animations based on the significance of the change
- Add user preference to enable/disable the animation
