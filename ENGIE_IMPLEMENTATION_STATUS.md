# Engie Component Fixes

## Current Issues

1. There are duplicate function declarations for `triggerScan` that need to be resolved.
2. There's a missing closing brace in the component structure.
3. There's a duplicate import for the `Switch` component.
4. Some function references are being used before they're declared.

## Next Steps

1. Create a new Engie.tsx file with the following changes:
   - Add the missing Switch import
   - Remove duplicate triggerScan function declarations
   - Fix the function order so dependencies are defined before they're used
   - Fix the component's closing brace structure

2. Complete the integration with the running app

3. Implement the remaining advanced AI features:
   - Voice capabilities
   - Batch apply functionality
   - Scenario planning
   - Connect to real backend APIs for chat/insights

4. Ensure proper testing for:
   - Contextual help
   - Onboarding experience
   - Proactive suggestions in real user flows

5. Verify accessibility, mobile-first design, and performance requirements

6. Add robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms

## Progress So Far

1. Fixed the "apply twice" bug: suggestions now apply on first click, all suggestions are cleared, and the document is re-analyzed for new suggestions.
2. Improved state management and added logging for debugging.
3. Enhanced the Engie component's TypeScript interfaces to support user preferences, organization context, insights, and learning/adaptation.
4. Implemented smart onboarding logic (role, mission, org size, personalized tips).
5. Added proactive suggestion logic and placeholder handlers for learning/adaptation.
6. Added undo capability and preview mode for suggestions.
7. Added a comprehensive, enhanced UI return statement for Engie.
