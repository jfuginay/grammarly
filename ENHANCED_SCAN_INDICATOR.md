# Enhanced Scan Indicator Implementation

## Overview
This branch implements a comprehensive scan status indicator for the text analysis features in the EnhancedEditor component. The enhanced indicator provides users with detailed visual feedback about the scanning process, including status messages, controls, and suggestion summaries.

## Features
- **Compact and Expanded Modes**:
  - Compact: Circular progress ring with status indicator
  - Expanded: Detailed panel with controls and information
- **Visual Status Indicators**:
  - Countdown: Circular progress with color transitions (green → yellow → orange)
  - Scanning: Blue spinner animation
  - Processing: Purple AI processing animation
  - Results: Green success state with suggestion count badge
- **User Controls**:
  - "Scan Now" button for immediate analysis
  - Auto-scan toggle switch
  - Scan interval slider
- **Suggestion Summary**:
  - Categorized counts (Grammar, Spelling, Clarity, Style)
  - Visual indicators for each category
- **Micro-Interactions**:
  - Hover effects for additional information
  - Smooth transitions between states
  - Pulse animations for state changes

## Technical Implementation
- React functional component with hooks for state management
- CSS Modules for component-specific styling and to avoid global CSS conflicts
- CSS animations for smooth transitions and effects
- Accessibility features including ARIA roles and labels
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Integration with the existing text analysis workflow

## Component Structure
- `EnhancedScanIndicator`: Main component handling all state and interactions
- CSS Module: `EnhancedScanIndicator.module.css` for component-specific styling

## Integration
The enhanced indicator is integrated into the EnhancedEditor component, replacing the previous ScanCountdownTimer. It maintains compatibility with all existing editor features while providing a more comprehensive user experience.

## Accessibility Considerations
- ARIA roles and labels for screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation for all controls
- Color combinations that meet WCAG contrast requirements
- Support for reduced motion preferences
- Clearly visible focus states

## Deployment Notes
- Uses CSS Modules instead of global CSS to avoid Next.js build errors
- Compatible with Vercel deployments
- No additional configuration required for build process
- Integrates seamlessly with existing styling

## How to Test
1. Open the application and navigate to any text editor
2. Type some text and stop typing
3. Observe the countdown timer showing the remaining time until scan
4. Click the timer to expand the detailed panel
5. Test the "Scan Now" button to trigger immediate analysis
6. Toggle the Auto-scan switch and observe the behavior
7. Adjust the scan interval using the slider
8. After a scan completes, check the suggestion summary
9. Test keyboard navigation through all controls

## Screenshots
The implementation includes both compact and expanded views:
