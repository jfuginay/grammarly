# Google Sign-In User Creation Fix

## Problem
Users signing in with Google OAuth were not being automatically created in the local database, which could cause issues when trying to access user-specific features.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive user creation system that ensures every authenticated user (whether through Google OAuth, email/password, or magic link) is automatically created or updated in the local database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Auth Callback (`src/pages/auth/callback.tsx`)
- Added automatic user creation after successful OAuth authentication
- Ensures user exists in database before redirecting to dashboard
- Graceful error handling - continues to dashboard even if DB creation fails

### 2. Improved AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Enhanced `onAuthStateChange` listener to automatically create users on sign-in
- Made `createUser` function more robust with proper error handling
- Updated all auth methods to handle user creation gracefully
- Changed `signInWithMagicLink` to allow creating new users (`shouldCreateUser: true`)

### 3. Robust User API Endpoint (`src/pages/api/users.ts`)
- Changed from `create` to `upsert` operation to handle existing users gracefully
- Updates email if user already exists (handles email changes)
- Returns consistent response format

### 4. Enhanced Google Button (`src/components/GoogleButton.tsx`)
- Added loading states and better error handling
- Improved user feedback with toast notifications
- Disabled button during authentication process

### 5. Added Testing Utility (`src/utils/test-user-creation.ts`)
- Created test function to verify user creation API works correctly
- Can be used for manual testing in browser console

## Key Features

### ✅ **Always Sign In Policy**
- If user doesn't exist in database → Creates new user and signs them in
- If user exists in database → Signs them in normally
- If database creation fails → Still allows sign-in (graceful degradation)

### ✅ **Multiple Auth Methods Supported**
- Google OAuth
- Email/Password
- Magic Link
- All methods ensure user creation in database

### ✅ **Robust Error Handling**
- Database failures don't block authentication
- Clear error messages for users
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### ✅ **User Data Synchronization**
- Email updates are handled through upsert operations
- User records stay synchronized with authentication provider

## Testing

To verify the changes work:

1. **Google Sign-In Test:**
   - Use Google sign-in with a new email
   - Check that user is created in database
   - Try signing in again - should work seamlessly

2. **Existing User Test:**
   - Sign in with an existing user
   - Verify no errors occur
   - Check that user data is updated if needed

3. **Manual API Test:**
   - Open browser console on your app
   - Run: `testUserCreation()`
   - Verify API handles create and upsert correctly

## Database Schema
The user creation works with your existing Prisma schema:
```prisma
model User {
  id        String     @id
  email     String?    @unique
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  documents Document[]
}
```

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these are set in your environment:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

This implementation ensures that **every user can always sign in successfully**, either by signing into their existing account or having a new account created automatically during the authentication process.
