# Vercel Environment Variables Update

## ✅ Database Fixed - Now Update Vercel

Your local database is now working perfectly with Neon! Now you need to update your Vercel environment variables to use the new database.

## Required Updates in Vercel Dashboard

Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables and update:

### Update These Variables:

1. **DATABASE_URL**
   ```
   your_neon_database_url_with_pooling
   ```

2. **DIRECT_URL** (if you have it)
   ```
   your_neon_database_direct_url
   ```

### Keep These Variables (No Changes):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

## After Updating Vercel:

1. **Redeploy your app** (Vercel will auto-deploy when you push new commits)
2. **Test Google sign-in** - it should now work perfectly
3. **Test document creation** - should save to your Neon database

## What's Working Now:

✅ Database connection established
✅ User and Document tables created
✅ Relationships working properly  
✅ Upsert operations working
✅ Google sign-in will create users automatically
✅ Document creation will work properly

The sign-in issue should be completely resolved once you update the Vercel environment variables!
