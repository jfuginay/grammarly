# Visual Countdown Timer for Text Scans

This document outlines the implementation of the visual countdown timer for grammar scanning in the EnhancedEditor component.

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

1. **ScanCountdownTimer.tsx**
   - A standalone React component that displays a circular progress ring with countdown visualization
   - Shows time remaining until next text scan (3 seconds by default)
   - Provides visual feedback for different states (countdown, analyzing, success)
   - Supports accessibility with appropriate ARIA attributes

2. **ScanCountdownTimer.css**
   - Styling for the countdown timer with animations and transitions
   - Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
   - Visual effects including pulse animation on scan completion

### Integration with EnhancedEditor

The countdown timer has been integrated into the EnhancedEditor component with the following features:

- Displayed in the bottom-right corner of the editor
- Only visible when there is text to analyze
- Automatically resets when the user is typing
- Shows "Analyzing" state during text analysis
- Briefly displays success state when suggestions are found
- Can be toggled on/off through the exposed API

### States

The timer has four distinct states:

1. **Ready** - Initial state when waiting for the 3-second countdown to begin
2. **Countdown** - Active countdown with color transition from green → yellow → orange
3. **Analyzing** - Blue spinner animation when text analysis is in progress
4. **Success** - Brief green checkmark when analysis is complete and suggestions are available

### Accessibility

- Proper ARIA roles and labels for screen readers
- Color changes provide visual feedback without relying solely on color
- Focus handling for keyboard navigation
- Descriptive text that appears on hover

## API

The EnhancedEditor component now exposes a new method in its ref:

```typescript
toggleCountdownTimer: () => void; // Method to toggle the countdown timer visibility
```

This can be used to show or hide the timer from parent components.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

- User preference to adjust the scan interval
- Option to disable automatic scanning completely
- More detailed visual feedback on the types of issues found
- Integration with system notification APIs for background scans
