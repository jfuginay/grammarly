# Security Cleanup Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: All Secrets Removed from Codebase

### What Was Removed:
1. **Neon Database Credentials**
   - Removed real database URLs from `.env` and documentation
   - Replaced with placeholder values

2. **OpenAI API Key**
   - Removed actual API key starting with `sk-proj-`
   - Replaced with placeholder in all files

3. **All Documentation Files Sanitized**
   - `DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md`
   - `VERCEL_UPDATE_NEEDED.md`
   - `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - `QUICK_DB_SETUP.md`
   - `.env.example`

### Security Measures Added:
1. **SECURITY.md** - Comprehensive security guidelines
2. **Placeholder Values** - All sensitive data replaced with clear placeholders
3. **Verification** - Multiple checks confirm no secrets remain

### Files Modified:
- `.env` - Replaced with placeholder values
- `.env.example` - Updated with better placeholders
- `DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md` - Sanitized all example credentials
- `VERCEL_UPDATE_NEEDED.md` - Removed real database URLs
- `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Removed project ID references
- `QUICK_DB_SETUP.md` - Removed project ID references
- `SECURITY.md` - New comprehensive security guide

### ✅ Verification Complete:
- No OpenAI API keys (`sk-proj-*`)
- No Neon database credentials
- No JWT tokens
- No hardcoded secrets anywhere

### Next Steps for Deployment:
1. Set up your own database (Neon recommended)
2. Get your own OpenAI API key
3. Set environment variables in Vercel
4. Follow the setup guides with your own credentials

**The codebase is now secure and ready for public distribution!**
