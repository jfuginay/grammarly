# Scan Countdown Timer Implementation

## Overview
This branch implements a visual countdown timer for the 3-second interval text scans in the EnhancedEditor component. The timer provides users with visual feedback about when the next automatic grammar scan will occur.

## Features
- Circular progress ring that shows the countdown status
- Color transitions from green → yellow → orange as time progresses
- Visual indicators for different states:
  - Countdown: Circular progress with seconds remaining
  - Analyzing: Blue spinner animation
  - Success: Green checkmark with pulse animation
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Accessibility support with ARIA attributes
- Automatic pause/resume when user is typing
- Toggleable visibility through the EnhancedEditor API

## Technical Implementation
- React functional component with hooks for state management
- CSS Modules for component-specific styling and to avoid global CSS conflicts
- CSS animations for smooth transitions and effects
- Integration with the existing text analysis workflow
- No external dependencies required

## Screenshots
The implementation includes a visual countdown timer that appears in the bottom-right corner of the editor:

## How to Test
1. Open the application and navigate to any text editor
2. Type some text and stop typing
3. Observe the countdown timer showing the remaining time until scan
4. When the countdown reaches zero, the timer should show the "Analyzing" state
5. After analysis completes, the timer should briefly show a success indicator
6. Start typing again to see the timer reset

## Future Enhancements
- User-configurable scan interval
- Option to disable automatic scanning
- More detailed visual feedback on the types of issues found
- Integration with system notification APIs
